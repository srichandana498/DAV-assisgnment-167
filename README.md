Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis  

Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about Netflix's content library.
Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset contains key details like title, type (Movie or TV Show), release year, genre, cast, country, duration, and more. The main goal was to dig into this data to better understand Netflix’s content strategy — what's being produced, when, where, and who’s behind it.
This project emphasizes data storytelling, visual exploration, and basic data wrangling, making it perfect for beginner to intermediate data analysts and enthusiasts.
In a world where streaming is king, Netflix sits right at the throne. This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset (thanks, Kaggle!) to understand what kind of content fills up our watchlists — from trending genres to countries producing the most binge-worthy shows.
The dataset includes info like title, type (movie or TV show), cast, director, country, release year, genre, duration, and more. The idea was to break it down, clean it up, and see what insights we can uncover about Netflix’s content evolution over time.
