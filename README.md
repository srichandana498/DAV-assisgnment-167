# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis  


## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about Netflix's content library.
Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset contains key details like title, type (Movie or TV Show), release year, genre, cast, country, duration, and more. The main goal was to dig into this data to better understand Netflix’s content strategy — what's being produced, when, where, and who’s behind it.
This project emphasizes data storytelling, visual exploration, and basic data wrangling, making it perfect for beginner to intermediate data analysts and enthusiasts.
In a world where streaming is king, Netflix sits right at the throne. This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to understand what kind of content fills up our watchlists — from trending genres to countries producing the most binge-worthy shows.
The dataset includes info like title, type (movie or TV show), cast, director, country, release year, genre, duration, and more. The idea was to break it down, clean it up, and see what insights we can uncover about Netflix’s content evolution over time.



# Technologies & Libraries Used


-} Python: Core language used for data analysis.

-} Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

-} NumPy: Numerical operations and efficiency improvements.

-} Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and storytelling through charts.

-} Google Colab: Development environment for running and documenting the code interactively.





# Approach

## Data Preparation

-} The dataset was imported using Pandas and initially examined using .info() and .isnull() to understand its structure and identify missing values.

-} Missing entries in the director, cast, and country columns were filled with "Unknown" to maintain data consistency.

-} The date_added column was converted to datetime format, and new columns (year_added and month_added) were extracted to enable time-based trend analysis.

-} No significant outliers or duplicates were found, ensuring a clean dataset ready for analysis.




## Exploratory Analysis


-} Content Type Breakdown: Visualized the overall distribution between Movies and TV Shows.

-} Top Countries: Highlighted the countries contributing the most content to Netflix.

-} Genre Distribution: Identified the most frequent categories by analyzing the listed_in column.

-} Release Year Trends: Explored how content additions have evolved over the years. 

-} Monthly Additions: Studied seasonal trends by observing content added month-wise.

-} Ratings Overview: Analyzed how different content types are distributed across ratings like TV-MA, PG, and others.



# Key Findings


-} Significant growth in content releases, especially post-2015, indicating Netflix’s investment in original programming.

-} Dramas and comedies emerged as the most dominant genres.

-} United States and India are the leading countries in terms of content production.

-} Most movies range between 90–120 minutes, while TV shows often consist of a single season.

-} Certain directors and actors appear frequently, indicating recurring collaborations or partnerships.




# Conclusion



The project effectively demonstrates how structured data analysis can provide insights into media consumption patterns and platform strategies. Through comprehensive EDA and visualization, we gained clarity on Netflix’s global offerings and content evolution. This analysis can be extended by integrating user reviews, regional preferences, or predictive models for content success. Future work may involve building dashboards, filtering by user demographics, or recommending content using machine learning models.
